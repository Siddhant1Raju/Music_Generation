Installation
To get started with the Music Generation project, you'll need to have Python 3.x and pip installed on your computer. Once you've confirmed that you have these prerequisites, you can clone the repository and install the required packages by running the following commands in your terminal:


git clone https://github.com/username/music-generation.git
cd music-generation
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all of the required packages for the project, including TensorFlow, Keras, and music21.

Usage
To generate a new musical piece, you can use the generate_music.py script. This script uses a pre-trained machine learning model to generate a piece of music in MIDI format. You can then use a MIDI player to listen to the generated music.


python generate_music.py
By default, the script will generate a piece of music that is 30 seconds long. You can customize the length of the generated music by using the --length option.


python generate_music.py --length 60
This will generate a piece of music that is 60 seconds long.
